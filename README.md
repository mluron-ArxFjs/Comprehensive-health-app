## Background information
What inspired you to create this app?

We believe that in order to be successful in monitoring your health, you can use our health tracker application!
<br>
Of the millions of apps available, health apps are some of the most popular. In fact, October-December 2015 research in ‌JMIR mHealth and uHealth‌ - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4704953/ - found that as many as 58 percent of people who owned a mobile device had at least one health app. 

## Technical challenges
What technical difficulties did you face programming your app?

One difficulty that we encountered while creating our application is the User's dashboard features. 


## Future developement
What improvements would you make if you were to create a 2.0 version of your app? 

In the future development, version 2.0 of our app, we will include more features to help the User to customize the services. For example we would add the possibility to Chat in real time in the ChatRoom either with friends or open space forum on Mental Health.
